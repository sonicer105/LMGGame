A NodeJS game made as part of the Floatplane Media hiring process.

You can find a live version [here](https://infinite-brook-45557.herokuapp.com/)
## Disclaimer
Though you can play this game on mobile phones, I do not recommended it. The game is best enjoyed on a desktop. Use a
tablet at the vary least.
## How To Play

* Use the <kbd>&downarrow;</kbd> or <kbd>S</kbd> key to go down a lane.
* You can also tap the top or bottom of the road to move up or down by one lane.
* Pick up coins to increase your score.
  * Team Red coins award 100 points.
  * Team Green coins award 250 points.
* Avoid flaming servers.
  * No, they are NOT the same ones as in Linus's server room.
    * <small>(I'm trying not to incur the wrath of Linus)</small>
## Build Directions
* Clone the Repo.
* run `npm install` in the project directory.
* then run `npm run start` to start the web server.
