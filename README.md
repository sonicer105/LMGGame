A NodeJS game made as part of the Floatplane Media hiring process.

You can find the LTT post about it ~~here~~ (Not making one until I hear back from Floatplane)

You can find a live version the master branch [here](https://infinite-brook-45557.herokuapp.com/)

## UPDATE 2017-05-16
Since I was not sure if the coding challenge was a "Pencils down, stop working" at the deadline deal, I have created a
branch called `timed-coding-challenge-final` that has my code up until the deadline and will not be updated. You can
find that [here](https://github.com/sonicer105/LMGGame/tree/timed-coding-challenge-final). I will continue to make
updates to branch `master`, namely I found a few bugs after submitting the project for review. Keep in mind that the live version link on that branch is tracking `master`, not `timed-coding-challenge-final` so the heorku app does not reflect that  version of the code.

## Disclaimer
Though you can play this game on mobile phones, I do not recommended it. The game is best enjoyed on a desktop. Use a
tablet at the vary least.

  * No, they are NOT the same ones as in Linus's server room.
    * <small>(I'm trying not to incur the wrath of Linus)</small>
## Build Directions
* Clone the Repo.
* run `npm install` in the project directory.
* then run `npm run start` to start the web server.
* the address is `localhost:3000` by default in non-production environments (port 80 in prod).
